# CV / Portfolio Page
This is a simple static HTML/CSS portfolio page. This project is using:
- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

Planning to implement [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow to automatically deploy the site whenever changes are pushed on the master branch.

To start a local development environment that changes in realtime, run `dev-server` task in [package.json](/package.json).
